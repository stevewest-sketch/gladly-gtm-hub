Summary
Nathan Smith introduced Ben Altneu and Ryan from Gladly’s new data and analytics partner, Unwrap.ai, who explained that Unwrap uses AI to aggregate unstructured customer feedback from sources including Gladly to extract granular insights, allowing mutual customers like Door Dash and Deckers to quickly detect product and merchant issues. Ben Altneu emphasized that this partnership provides Gladly with a best-in-class tool to compete with all-in-one solutions, potentially making Gladly a "stickier product," while also sharing end-of-year incentives aligned with mid-market deals. During the platform demo, Ryan illustrated how Unwrap pulls feedback from 7 to 10 sources, provides proactive alerts on major issues within 15 minutes of an incident, and offers deep analysis on each issue, which aligns with the "conversational intelligence" and "voice of customer" solutions described by Emilio Di Zazzo, while also confirming for Nate Larkin that Unwrap can extract details like return reasons from conversations.

Details
Notes Length: Standard
	•	Meeting Logistics and Introductions The meeting started with brief technical issues for Nathan Smith's audio, which were quickly resolved (00:00:00). Gina Vivar noted there were about 30 guests and mentioned the meeting would be recorded and shared (00:01:40). Nathan Smith, Head of Partnerships at Gladly, introduced Ben Altneu, an AE at Unwrap, and Ryan, Unwrap's CEO, as representatives of Gladly's new data and analytics partner, Unwrap.ai (00:02:49). Ben Altneu acknowledged the familiar faces from their time at Gladly and introduced Ryan and Nick (Head of Growth Marketing) from Unwrap (00:03:47).
	•	Unwrap.ai's Value Proposition Ben Altneu outlined the agenda, which included introducing Unwrap, explaining why CX leaders use them, sharing an end-of-year incentive, and demonstrating the platform (00:03:47). Unwrap aggregates unstructured qualitative customer feedback from multiple sources, including Gladly conversations, surveys (Medallia, Qualtrics), and social media, using AI to extract granular insights automatically. This capability allows CX teams at mutual customers like Door Dash and Deckers to quickly detect issues, such as merchant tablet failures or specific shoe defects, often in minutes, compared to previous detection times ranging from two days to four weeks (00:06:00).
	•	Strategic Benefits of the Partnership Ben Altneu explained that the partnership with Unwrap provides Gladly with a best-in-class tool to compete against all-in-one solutions like Sprinkler and Qualtrics, which offer their own analytics. Unwrap addresses the need for better insights when CSMs hear this requirement, potentially making Gladly a "stickier product" during renewals, and offers co-selling opportunities to grow ACVs by an estimated 20% to 30% (00:08:41). Furthermore, customer service data is a top-valued qualitative feedback source for Unwrap's customers, providing an additional opportunity for Gladly to avoid missing evaluations (00:09:55).
	•	End-of-Year Incentives and Target Opportunities Ben Altneu announced the official end-of-year incentives for the Gladly team, noting that Unwrap opportunities between $50,000 and $250,000 align with Gladly's mid-market deals, while quarter-million-plus opportunities are in the enterprise space. They emphasized that the demo would help empower the Gladly team to better recommend Unwrap when customers express a need for deeper insights from qualitative data (00:10:57).
	•	Use Cases and Data Accessibility Kristen Miller asked about the biggest use case for Unwrap, suggesting collaboration between CX and Product teams, and how data is exposed (00:12:06). Ben Altneu confirmed the value proposition focuses on joining CX and Product by democratizing insights, allowing Product teams to self-serve and access alerts related to areas they own. Kristen Miller suggested Restoration Hardware as a target customer, as 90% of their issues are product related (00:12:55).
	•	Unwrap Platform Demo: Data Ingestion and Proactive Alerts Ryan, Unwrap CEO, began the demo with an example using Lululemon data, illustrating that Unwrap pulls in a holistic picture of customer feedback from 7 to 10 sources, including Gladly, Google/Yelp reviews, Reddit, and Medallia (00:13:50). Onboarding typically takes two weeks, requiring about an hour of partner time for authentication without engineering work (00:14:55). Ryan highlighted the proactive nature of the platform, which automatically categorizes feedback, detects anomalies, and sends alerts for major issues (e.g., damaged packages from FedEx in New York) within 15 minutes of an incident (00:16:02) (00:21:59). These insights can be customized for different teams, such as e-commerce or product quality (00:18:10).
	•	Deep Dive into Issue Analysis The platform provides a dedicated page for each issue, including a time series, detailed summary, verbatims, agent resolution paths, and links back to the original Gladly ticket (00:19:07). Ryan confirmed that Unwrap ingests all conversation types, including full bot, phone call, and live chat, and can analyze bot performance, such as reasons for escalation to a human (00:21:08). Emilio Di Zazzo categorized Unwrap within the CX tech landscape as falling under "conversational intelligence" and "voice of customer" solutions, particularly those seeking aggregated insights (00:19:57).
	•	Data Sources and Granular Tagging Jezzica Bellitti inquired about the scope of data sources. Ryan confirmed they cover three buckets: support systems (like Gladly), surveys (like Qualtrics), and public sources (like Google, Yelp, Reddit, X, and G2) (00:22:53). Ryan showcased the Explore page, where feedback is organized into a deep, automatically generated hierarchy (taxonomy), achieving over 90% tagging accuracy and evolving as issues change (00:23:58). Ben Altneu added that this AI tagging significantly improves accuracy over manual tagging systems, which often operate at a 70–72% rate (00:26:03).
	•	Data Extraction from Conversations Nate Larkin asked whether Unwrap's value proposition includes extracting data like product feedback from conversations, eliminating the need for agents to manually input data via forms and fields. Ben Altneu confirmed that if details like return reasons or complaints (e.g., shredded laces) are included in the conversation, Unwrap can extract them, reducing reliance on agent dropdown tagging or customer pre-chat selections (00:27:09).
	•	Self-Service Functionality with Assistant Ryan demonstrated the "Assistant" chatbot, a self-service tool available to all users (Unwrap does not use a seat-based license). Users can ask questions like "What are the top issues related to product quality?" and request visualizations, which can be saved or screenshotted for reporting (00:28:09). Vicky Tran asked about editing the autogenerated charts. Ryan stated that while users can save the charts to a dashboard for analysis or change the chart type (e.g., to a temporal chart), the ability to modify the content of the charts via the Assistant (e.g., removing a specific item) is "coming soon" (00:30:22). Ryan also confirmed that pricing is based on feedback volume (00:29:12).
	•	Meeting Conclusion Nathan Smith thanked Ryan and Ben Altneu for their presentation, confirming that the slides would be shared in the enablement channel, along with keywords for the teams to use. He also reminded the team of the shared Slack channel for Unwrap.ai .

Suggested next steps
	•	Nathan Smith will work with Ben Altneu on the slides to put them in the enablement channel.
	•	Nathan Smith and Ben Altneu will work together to get the slides for the team and put them in the enablement channel.

Go ahead. All right. Great. Uh, well, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining. Uh, and hopefully you enjoy this break from QBRS. Um, I'm Nathan Smith, head of partnerships here at Gladly. Very excited to have been uh, who a few of you might know and Ryan from Unwrap.ai. AI, a new data and analytics partner here at Gladly. So, uh, they have a great session lined up for us here today and some probably some other exciting things as part of that. But I'll I'll leave that uh leave that to Ben and Ryan to share. So, without further ado, Ryan, Ben, take it away. Ben Altneu: Excellent. Thanks, Nathan. Um, really, really nice to see so many uh familiar faces here.    
00:03:47
  Ben Altneu: Um, you know, as many of you know, I I really enjoyed my time at Gladly. Um, and it's, yeah, it's fun to look back and always always a trip to be back in front of you. Um, for those that don't know, I'm I'm Ben. I'm an AE at Unwrap. Um, I'm joined here by Ryan, who is Unwrap CEO, and also Nick in the room over there in Santa Barbara, uh, who is Unwrap's head of growth marketing. So, real quick, thank you to to Nathan for having us in today. Um, we've got a ton to cover. Nerds - SBHQ: That's coming. Ben Altneu: I know we're I think we're right up against QBRS at the at the half hour here, so we'll we'll go and cover as much as we can. So, I'll I'll dive in uh with our agenda here. Um, and I've got a couple slides up that I'll share with you. Um, this I, you know, I'll share these slides kind of to start to one illustrate who Unwrap is and the challenges that we're solving for customers that, you know, in a lot of ways look very much uh, like Gladley's in including some mutual customers like uh, Deckers and Door Dash and Bobby Rad Powerbikes to name a few.    
00:04:52
  Ben Altneu: Uh we'll then share a bit about why CX leaders use unwrap um and why it really you know why we think it matters for you all uh at Gladly. And then before we jump into a demo uh I'll share the end ofear incentive that we're extending to all of you for including us in your opportunities. Some of you have already and we're we're very very grateful for that. Um, and like I said, from there, um, Ryan will lead us through a a brief demo so that you can all, uh, really visualize what these benefits for CX leaders look like. And you will know what to do uh, when customers say things like, hey, I need, you know, I need better insights from my qualitative data or I need uh, faster issue detection. Um, so hopefully that'll all become clear, you know, by the end of the 30 minutes. uh from anyone in the group before we jump in. Um any questions before we get started? If not, I'll I'll kind of cruise on through. Cool. Feel free to jump in at any time, by the way.    
00:06:00
  Ben Altneu: Uh so, so let's start with um what Unwrap actually does. So it starts with the premise um that the qualitative feedback that our customers receive comes in many different forms from many different uh sources and it's often unstructured. So in addition to uh Gladly conversations customers are combing through their survey data from Medallia or from Qualrix you know they're combing through social media and their NPS surveys sees and and plenty more from there. It's a ton of manual effort in order to aggregate all of this data and even harder to sift through it uh to find really granular insights. So that's where Unwrap comes in. We we use AI to aggregate and then automatically extract really granular insights from all of these sources so that you know as as an example um you know Door Dash's customer experience team is notified within just a couple minutes that their merchant tablets uh are down um or so that de like Decker's mutual customer um their Hoka team uh knows that Hoka customers in the US are complaining that specific shoes laces are wearing prematurely.    
00:07:20
  Ben Altneu: Granularity like that is what unwrap can automatically provide to to these leaders. Um and the important thing here is that these insights are surfaced without anyone telling unwrap to go find them. So we identify unknown issues within these this sea of feedback so that customers don't need to constantly go looking for them. Um and so far uh CX leaders are are relying on these insights to do a few things. The first is to identify issues really really quickly. So where their average time to detection for something big or small uh is now under an hour uh where it was anywhere from probably two days to maybe four weeks uh before onboarding unwrap. So, it's it's a pretty dramatic uh decrease in time to detection. As I mentioned, they're also um uncovering the unknowns in their feedback without needing to spend hours and hours searching through to find them. And then lastly, they're they're able to own uh the voice of the customer and build alignment with their internal business partners by um going to them with databacked insights that really reflect what the customer is asking for.    
00:08:41
  Ben Altneu: And so for you all at Gladly, um, a partnership with Unwrap means that you get to add another best-in-class tool to your arsenal in order to better compete with the all-in- ones. So, you know, Sprinkler says that they have this sort of stuff, this these sorts of analytics. Um, Qualrix in the survey space, uh, you know, they sell their XM analytics. uh and there are a number of point solutions that use you know pretty in our in our view anyway um pretty legacy technology to tackle this space um second thing is that when yeah is there a question no Nerds - SBHQ: way deeper. Ben Altneu: okay um okay secondly when when CSMS hear things like I need better insights you've now got an answer to that so we imagine that uh this will you know in add in addition to keeping customers happy. Uh ideally it'll make Gladly a stickier product when it comes to renewal time. Um and then on the pre-sale side, we have the opportunity now to co-sell and and perhaps eventually join in on a on a reseller agreement where you can grow ACVS by, you know, what we estimate is about 20 to 30%.    
00:09:55
  Ben Altneu: Um, and then lastly, you know, we we like to think we have a lot of really great customers between, you know, you saw the NASCAR slide um a couple slides ago, but between Southwest and Door Dash and Bose and Whoop and Aura, Lululemon, um, when it comes to the the value of their qualitative sources of feedback, customer service data is always at the top of that list. So the first questions our customers ask us when they're considering a move is like hey do you do you integrate with X uh platform which for you all is one more uh set of eyes and ears you know out in the wild so that you don't miss an evaluation. Obviously that's that's really important when it's a renewals business. So um with that in mind we have some incentives to share with you all officially. I think they're they were previewed a couple weeks ago, but here they are uh you know officially in slide form that so these are going to run till at least uh the end of the year. So you can all read the specifics here.    
00:10:57
  Ben Altneu: I'll just call out a couple things. Um so with your with your shift to focusing on Gladly AI and and volume based pricing, I imagine the list of largest prospects and customers has probably shifted a bit. Um, and just so we kind of um have a kind of a frame of reference here, the 50,000 to $250,000 opportunities for UNRAP are pretty well aligned with the mid-market deals that Gladly sees. Uh, and anything above that, you know, quarter million plus are primarily in the enterprise space. So, um, we, you know, we want to make this worth your while. we want to be included uh you know where customers say like hey we want we want deeper insights from our qualitative data. Um hopefully with uh the demo that Ryan's going to share you'll you'll have a better idea of kind of what that looks and feels like and are better armed to uh make those recommendations for customers. Um that's it for the slides. Before we jump into the demo, any questions so far? Kristen Miller: Ben, I will come off camera with my um scary sick face and uh just say thank you.    
00:12:06
  Kristen Miller: That was awesome. It's so nice to see you again. Ben Altneu: So nice to see you, Kristen. Kristen Miller: Um I am I feel like I'm I'm thinking about all these use cases obviously with retail like I just remember all birds in 2018 like if you had something if they knew about something like this then because their biggest thing was how do we surface this up from a cross collaboration um perspective right because the product team is not going to be able to take what they have today and understand what were the issues with those shoelaces what model was it and when did it come in stock right like all those things this is this is just awesome are you seeing the biggest use case really being between CX in product and I I think maybe in the demo I guess the second part of that is how are the data exposed? Is this something that like end users like the VP of product could go in and actually see firsthand. Ben Altneu: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, it's it's really a combination of of kind of joining it's it's joining CX and product.    
00:12:55
  Ben Altneu: And this will become really clear in the demo. Half of half of the value prop here is democratization of of insights, right? Kristen Miller: Right. Ben Altneu: CX really owns the largest data sources but you have so many people in the organization across product and across other departments who need access to them and you're you know your CX leader at Alberts or or any of Kristen Miller: All right. Ben Altneu: them they don't necessarily want to be responsible for you know disseminating all of the insights to everyone make this a self-s serve experience for CX to own the voice of the customer uh but easy enough to access so that you know product can come in make improvements search for the answers to questions that they're interested in and get the same types of alerts about the topics and areas of the product that they own. Kristen Miller: It's amazing. Yeah. If you haven't gone after Restoration Hardware yet, go after them because 90% of their issues are product related. So, that should be your target then. Ben Altneu: They're they're on a list, I assure you.    
00:13:50
  Kristen Miller: Okay. Thanks, Ben Altneu: Cool. Anybody else? Cool. Okay, Brian, over to you. Nerds - SBHQ: All right, thanks Ben. Um, excited to dive in and show you guys a quick demo. Um, feel free to interrupt, ask questions. Um, but I'll try to hit the highlights and mainly focus on, you know, why do gladly customers um, buy Unwrap. So, um, this is a demo instance for Google Lemon. um they're one of our customers, but this is an instance um that I'm able to share publicly. Um the first thing that we do for folks is we get data into the platform. So one of the value ads for our customers is that we pull in obviously Gladly data but also other sources as well. So our customers on average um have between seven and 10 feedback sources. um their sort of support system um ticketing system or call system is usually the largest by volume but they have other ones they care about as well.    
00:14:55
  Nerds - SBHQ: So in Lulu's case um this may be Gladly for example um but also you know Google and Yelp reviews for physical store locations Reddit Medallia surveys etc. Um and so we pull in the holistic picture of all of your customer feedback. Um to do that it's pretty straightforward. So onboarding to unwrap typically takes um 2 weeks in total and that's mainly our time. Um it's usually only about an hour of our uh partners' time to actually get set up. Um you you come in here um and you integrate with the source that you're looking for. So for example, GLY um you come in here um and it walks you through the authentication process. All that's required is typically the authenticating. There's no engineering work required or technical resources to actually go deploy anything. Um just the authentic authentication part and you do the same thing for your you know five or six sources you care about. So the aggregation piece is certainly a value ad that that our customers uh get from unrep.    
00:16:02
  Nerds - SBHQ: Beyond that, um I think the the number one value, this was the first thing that Ben called out in his slide, is identifying defects and issues faster. And we believe that our platform should be very proactive. And so instead of someone coming in and having to uh make a dashboard or ask a question, we're going to proactively service insights to our customers. And so this is front and center in the homepage. Every time a customer logs in, they're going to see these top insights uh built for them that are automatically detected by our system. And so how this works is we are taking all that feedback in every single day. We are automatically categorizing it at really specific levels. And I'll show you what this looks like in a second. And then we are automatically detecting anomalies and sending out alerts. So, for example, um if Lululemon was getting an increased amount of uh complaints about damaged packages, we can proactively send that inside out via Slack, via email, usually within 15 minutes of the actual incident happening.    
00:17:08
  Nerds - SBHQ: And so here you have u that incident you have a title that we generate automatically you have a few sentences explain what's important about that issue and then you have a handful of customer verbatims. Um the description of the issue is is really important because this helps um give more details about the incident and helps our customers take the actual corrective action. So here you there's a report of of damaged packages. The natural next question for our customer is where is this? What carrier is this? How widespread is this? We are able to auto detect in this case what location it is and the carrier. So here it says um it's mainly from FedEx. And it looks like it's mainly in New York because New York makes up 88% of these complaints despite making up 5% of of all feedback. And so you automatically now have an alert pushed to you that talks about this issue, flags it as being, you know, related to FedEx and New York without you having to do anything.    
00:18:10
  Nerds - SBHQ: And so our teams use us as sort of a first line of defense to um find issues that, you know, may take more time to bubble up. If you think about for frontline support teams, they are, you know, trying to close tickets as effectively as possible. They're not always looking, you know, taking a step back and looking at the broader trend. Um, and that's where that's where unwrap comes in. And so every week you're going to get different insights here, um, automatically sent for you. And these can be customized by team. So at Lululemon, they have an ecom team, they have a shipping and logistics team, they have a product quality team. Each team is getting different insights sent to them u based on their role and what they care about. And then let's say this one is really important to you and you say, "s***, I didn't know that's broken. Um, I want to go investigate this further." I can click on this and I have a dedicated page for this issue.    
00:19:07
  Nerds - SBHQ: And so here I have the time series. I have a more detailed summary and I have all of the verbatims. So here looks like there's 68 mentions. Um, a lot of this comes from Gladly. I see a summary of the issue. Here I see a resolution path. So what was the resolution path that the agent took? These are both automatically u deduced by our system. I can then click in and see the raw back and forth. So if this is a phone call, I can see the transcript here. If this is a chat conversation, I see a chat conversation, email, etc. Um and we also link back to Gladly. So if someone wants to go actually see the ticket in Gladly, this will link you back to that ticket if you have permission to go view that. Um and then just the kind of the last thing to call out here is that you know this entire page is built automatically.    
00:19:57
  Nerds - SBHQ: Um so you know somewhat similar to gladly topics um but typically um a bit more granular and so you're able to detect this issue automatically form this page automatically um and send the alert and have you dive deeper if you'd like. Any questions on that flow from, you know, proactive alert to diving in deeper and and um digging into what the actual issue was? Emilio Di Zazzo: Hey Ben, nice to see you again. Um, Brian, thanks for that. would would um just trying to understand like what category would this fall into in the CX like tech landscape is it what people are calling conversational analytics these days just so we could recognize in RFPs or like you know set of requirements um would that be a fair bucket to put you in and don't want to put you in a bucket like necessarily but um you know Ben mentioned a few competitors but things like Hallminer or Nerds - SBHQ: Yep. Emilio Di Zazzo: Cresta probably fall into that category Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah. I think there's two main categories that we that we sort of fall into and like if these come up, you know, your ears should perk up.    
00:21:08
  Nerds - SBHQ: One is conversational intelligence, so extracting more information, which is Abby said. The other one is like a voice of customer. Um, so I want to see in general, you know, what are our customers talking about uh for our brand across, you know, multiple sources. Emilio Di Zazzo: Yeah. Nerds - SBHQ: I'm looking for a voice of customer solution. I'm looking for an aggregated insights solution. Um, that's sort of the other bucket. Emilio Di Zazzo: And I would assume like in our tech stack that would include the live support conversations across any channel as well as anything that's AI uh driven. You guys can also you know analyze those interactions, right? Nerds - SBHQ: Correct. Whether it is like a full bot conversation, whether it's a phone call, whether it's a live chat, those are all conversations that we ingest. And they have slightly different purposes. For for bots, it's like, hey, how well is the bot doing? And when it has to escalate to a human, why is that?    
00:21:59
  Nerds - SBHQ: Right? So, what are the reasons why we're having to escalate? Um, whereas for phone call, it might be slightly different. You know, u what's leading to longer phone calls, what's leading to unresolved uh phone calls, etc. Emilio Di Zazzo: and last question. Um, on the alert side, how how like um a lot of analytics tools out there are post analysis, you know, whether it's a QA or hey, I need to put together reports, but sounds like you guys can actually trigger maybe not real time, but near real time type of analysis based on different settings. Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah, it's a good question. So, yes, I would say near real time. um our SLA for major issues that within 15 minutes of the incident, we should be able to set an alert. Um and so it's not real time in the sense that like we're coaching agents in real time. We don't do any sort of anything like that. Um but this should be pretty quick as far as incident and then alert.    
00:22:53
  Emilio Di Zazzo: Cool. Thank you. Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah. Um any other questions about that flow? Yeah. Jezzica Bellitti: Hey Ryan. Um, what data sources do you have? I saw Reddit on there. Um, Google reviews. Do you have any other social media? Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah. Jezzica Bellitti: Maybe X. Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah. Great question. So, we have three buckets, but I think it's helpful to start here and then I'll I'll dive into specifics. So, one is um support. So, this would be like a gladly, like a Zenesk, uh etc. We then have surveys which is Qualrix, Medallion, Type Form, Survey Monkey, uh, etc. And then public and public includes Google, Yel, Reddit. We do have Twitter, uh, we have like G2, we have, um, what, like BB, BBB, um, YPO. So, a lot of different public sources as well. And X and Reddit are probably the two most most common ones. Jezzica Bellitti: All right. Thank you.    
00:23:58
  Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah. All right. Um, two last things I want to showcase. Um, so I'm going to start on the explore page and then go to assistant. So our explore page is where um, we are organizing your feedback into this hierarchy. Um, a big value prop for customers that they're able to get much more granular tags um, into feedback than they currently have today. And so, for example, with ecom, um, you can go, you know, really, really deep. So, you go ecom checkout experience, payment issues, um, gift card usage problems, unable to use a gift card, unable to use my gift card to purchase the city sweat jar, right? So, you're able to get super super deep and these are generated automatically. So, let's say that a new issue pops up like this issue never existed before in the history of Lululemon. All of a sudden, it pops up. We're going to recognize that as a distinct issue. We're going to form that that label.    
00:25:01
  Nerds - SBHQ: We're going to tag feedback historically and we're going to build, you know, dedicated page for that issue. Um, and so this taxonomy is constantly evolving over time as your product and issues change and it's self-maintained. So form a new group, it'll automatically place it in the right hierarchy and then tag feedback retroactively. Any questions on like the tagging process? Jezzica Bellitti: Do you measure your tagging accuracy? Nerds - SBHQ: Totally. Yeah. All the time. Um, right now we're 90 plus% precise. This is obviously like this is the core of the platform. This is what we do really well. Everything sort of stems from this. And so our ability to accurately and granularly tag feedback is like the core value prop of the business. Um and so we're constantly measuring performance then you know constantly improving this when we notice um either our own models are outperforming sort of models or a new LM models released and so this is like the core IP of the the Pray.    
00:26:03
  Nerds - SBHQ: Jesus. Jezzica Bellitti: Cool. Thank you. Ben Altneu: And for there you can think about too like the the difference between accuracy uh in in using topics or tags versus like a 90 or 95% accurate um you know AI tagging system. You know we talked to you know, throughout our mutual customers and and you know, I think Alta is a great example, chatted with them as well, like they they manually and programmatically tag at I think a like a 70 or 72% uh accuracy rate. So immediately bumping that up, you know, 20 25%. Um, and getting more granular insights means that those folks can uh kind of pinpoint really really granular issues and and disseminate them across the arc. Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah, Nate Larkin: Yeah, I'm curious, Ben, this might be for you, but like in the deals that we've brought you and it's kind of like replacing our gap on forms and fields. I'm wondering like part of how you guys are talking to customers is a value prop that like, hey, agents don't need to be putting in this data, it's all in the conversation.    
00:27:09
  Nate Larkin: We take that data and actually extract it out like product feedback or are a lot of people still using forms and fields for a lot of that product feedback um and dispositioning like in Zenes like a form on Ben Altneu: uh forms and forms and fields. How do you mean? Nate Larkin: the side. So, hey, what what was the return reason? You know, product XYZ like your Hoka shoe example like uh they wanted to return or they're complaining about, you know, shredded laces. Ben Altneu: Yeah. Yeah. So if that if those details are included in the in the conversation, you know, in a chat conversation in a phone call, we can extract those those reasons uh out from the actual conversation and don't have to rely on the on on the agent tagging those from a drop down or or even the even the customer selecting those kind of upfront before they uh before they chat in, for example. Nerds - SBHQ: Cool. All right, I realize we're almost at time. Last thing I want to show you is assistant.    
00:28:09
  Nerds - SBHQ: Um I think someone else asked about like who has access to this and um how easy is it to self-s serve? Um that's an important part of our platform. We want it to be uh very self-service. because of that we don't have a seatbased license. So we we encourage any one of our our customers to to make an account. Um and one of the most the easiest to use tools to self-service is assistant. And so this is a chatbot that we've built just for this use case. And you can ask you know any types of questions that you'd expect our customers to ask. And so for example, you could say, "What are the top issues related to product quality?" So let's say I'm on the product quality team at New Llemon. Um, this is probably a question I I think about every day. Um, Unwrap makes it really easy to get um pretty specific answers to these questions. So you have overall clothing quality and you have a few specific uh concerns.    
00:29:12
  Nerds - SBHQ: Do you pull from MS Shopify data? Yeah, we do. Um, durability concerns, fabric and material issues, aesthetic issues, fit and comfort. Let's say that you're really diving into clothing quality. Um, you can then say plot all of the clothing quality sub issues on a horizontal bar chart. I'm not spelling things right, but should still work. Um this allows you to also um make digital assets for presentations etc. So you now have a stack bar chart that you're able to uh take a screenshot of um and put in a report or save to our own dashboarding functionality to dive deeper. Um and then I saw a question around commercials around pricing. We price based on feedback volume. So, if a customer gets 100,000 tickets and PCB back a month, there's a tier for that. If it's a million piece back a month, we have tiers for that. Nathan Smith: That's great, Ryan. Vicky Tran: So on this reporting thanks so on this assistant that we're seeing and this autogenerated Yes.    
00:30:22
  Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah. Vicky Tran: Yeah. So this autogenerated chart is this like a GPT where you can go back and iterate on it and say it's like you know what we're already fixing the buttons coming loose. Can you take that out? Nerds - SBHQ: coming soon. Um, right now you could save this to a dashboard um and do more analysis there. Um, assistant, you don't have the ability. You can do some things like I could say um change this to a chart over time. So, if I want to see um an actual like temporal chart, I can see that. Um, you don't yet have the ability to say, "Okay, remove this item." Um but that is coming soon. Vicky Tran: Okay. Gotcha. And I'm guessing that the converse, can you add an item too, even if it's smaller and doesn't really take up a bunch of volume? Nerds - SBHQ: Yep. You can do that today from from the dashboarding page. Nathan Smith: Awesome. Nerds - SBHQ: Um it's coming soon to do that just with assistant. Vicky Tran: Okay. Gotcha. Thank you. Nerds - SBHQ: Yeah. Nathan Smith: Ryan, Ben, thank you. Uh, thank you all so much for being here. We will, uh, get the slides from you, Ben. I'll work with you a little bit more on those slides. We'll get the into our enablement channel here and put it up for the teams to be able to use. We want to hit on, uh, you know, the key words to be looking for, things like that, so the team is empowered and knows when when their ears should be perked up.
