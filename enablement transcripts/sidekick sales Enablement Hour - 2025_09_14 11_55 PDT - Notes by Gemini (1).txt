Summary
Gina Vivar and Austin Reece provided an overview of Sidekick Sales, emphasizing its general availability, goal to convert hesitant shoppers by increasing average order value without discounting, and use of AI as a sales associate. Austin Reece and Kyle Kacius highlighted Sidekick Sales' differentiators, core components, and its leveraging of Gladly's existing AI architecture. Kyle Kacius also presented an enhanced chat experience, and discussed market trends and a vision for a more conversational e-commerce experience with Austin Reece, while Kristen Miller inquired about Sidekick Sales' compatibility with different commerce systems.

Details
	•	Sidekick Sales Overview Gina Vivar introduced Sidekick Sales, highlighting its recent launch and excitement for the product (00:01:33). Austin Reece further explained that Sidekick Sales is generally available (GA) and aims to convert hesitant shoppers by addressing plateauing conversion rates and rising customer acquisition costs (00:03:29). The primary goal is to increase average order value without discounting, protect margins, and leverage AI as a sales associate (00:05:38).
	•	Sidekick Sales Differentiators Austin Reece outlined six key differentiators for Sidekick Sales, emphasizing its speed to value, with 23 customers already live and generating revenue. They highlighted the ability to point Sidekick Sales directly at a website to use its content as a knowledge source, eliminating the need for in-depth integrations or product catalog connections (00:05:38). Another key differentiator is providing a single touchpoint for service and sales, enhancing the overall customer experience by unifying conversations (00:06:30).
	•	Core Components of Sidekick Sales Austin Reece detailed that Sidekick Sales functions as a new set of use cases for Sidekick, primarily focused on answering product questions, providing product recommendations, and assisting live agents with relevant context (00:07:35). The solution packages web content knowledge sources, templated guides, and Gladly's existing AI architecture. Web content acts as a knowledge source, allowing the AI to pull text, images, and PDFs from product pages to inform customer conversations (00:08:35).
	•	Templated Guides for Easy Setup Austin Reece explained that templated guides, particularly for product questions and recommendations, streamline the setup process for customers (00:09:37). Kyle Kacius added that customers can get Sidekick Sales set up and running live in production in less than 20 minutes, significantly improving the time to value (00:10:42). Kyle Kacius also clarified that the system dynamically pulls content from URLs in real-time when a consumer asks a question, ensuring up-to-date information (00:11:41).
	•	Leveraging Gladly's AI Architecture Austin Reece emphasized that Sidekick Sales utilizes Gladly's established AI architecture, which includes a thorough tech stack with various models, a robust context and knowledge layer, a trust layer for ensuring on-brand responses, and various integrations. This infrastructure is tried and tested, being the same as that used for other Sidekick conversations (00:13:12).
	•	Enhanced Chat Experience (Kickass Demo) Kyle Kacius presented an updated demo, internally called "kickass demo," showcasing an improved chat experience that will ultimately come into the product (00:14:14) (00:16:44). The new features include a different chat button allowing direct message typing, a modernized interface with brand logos and customizable colors, and the ability to return images alongside text responses (00:18:00). This visual engagement aims to keep consumers more engaged, increasing the likelihood of purchases (00:19:11). Kyle Kacius also noted that future developments include showing tables for product comparisons and a wider chat experience (00:20:27). These chat improvements will be available to all customers, not just those using Sidekick Sales (00:21:39).
	•	Market Trends and Vision Austin Reece and Kyle Kacius discussed the broader trend in e-commerce towards unifying various customer engagement methods into a single, seamless experience. Kyle Kacius expressed a vision for a more conversational experience as AI advances, suggesting that asking questions will replace browsing long product pages for information (00:22:52). Kyle Kacius also noted that e-commerce leaders are showing significant interest in Sidekick Sales due to its ability to increase average order value and conversion rates, driving revenue (00:15:37).
	•	Competitive Landscape Austin Reece categorized competitors into four buckets: AI shopping assistants (e.g., Big Su), AI agents for customer service (e.g., Sierra), support suites (e.g., Zendesk), and product recommendations/discovery widgets (e.g., Nostto) (00:27:41). They detailed Gladly's differentiation by highlighting Sidekick Sales' rapid launch time, its independence from product catalog integrations, and its ability to unite service and sales conversations into a single, lifelong customer experience (00:32:42). Gladly focuses on turning support teams into growth engines, contrasting with competitors that primarily focus on deflection (00:33:46).
	•	Go-to-Market Strategy Austin Reece advised focusing on the customer service leader as the primary buyer persona initially, as it is an easier conversation based on current functionality. By early October, they anticipate unlocking the e-commerce buyer persona with new functionality, including revenue tracking and e-commerce-specific product features (00:36:04). Austin Reece provided an elevator pitch for customer service leaders, emphasizing how support can become a revenue driver through a unified solution that handles pre-purchase questions and accelerates live agent handoffs with context (00:38:24).
	•	Customer Success and Resources Austin Reece highlighted the success of the limited rollout, with 23 well-known customers already live and generating revenue. Crystal, Head of CXOPS at Tokovas, provided an approved quote, stating that Sidekick Sales helped connect with high-intent shoppers, guide them to products, and drive immediate revenue, leading to a 55% resolution rate for product questions (00:39:44). Austin Reece detailed available sales assets, including a messaging brief, a command of the message guide, market analysis, new slide inserts with example presentations, a script, a differentiator battle card, and existing one-pagers and hype videos (00:40:39).
	•	Agnostic to Commerce Systems Kristen Miller inquired about Sidekick Sales' compatibility with different commerce systems. Kyle Kacius confirmed that the system is completely agnostic to the e-commerce system because it solely pulls publicly available content from web pages (00:46:51). This approach eliminates the need for API integrations for initial setup, significantly contributing to the less than 20-minute setup time (00:48:04). However, Kyle Kacius clarified that customers can still augment the system with API integrations for additional information, such as inventory or store locations (00:50:10).

Suggested next steps
	•	Gina Vivar will post a follow-up message in the fieldcom's channel later today with links to all the assets discussed.
	•	The group will provide feedback on the assets as they start to use them and let Austin Reece know about any changes.

  Austin Reece: What's up, Dina? Gina Vivar's Presentation: Don't know where the switches are. The way you keep the color and I'll probably crash a stupid car. Make your life a misery. But we could be nice to each other. Nice to each other. Wrong for each other. Rise for each other. Rise to each other. Rise to each other. M cuz you know I don't know the classic stuff. It never works. You know it. So can we say we'll never say the classic love to show it. Now, now meet me on the mountain top. I'll be in the show and wait for you to call it all home. Cuz I don't want a boyfriend. But we could be nice to each other. Nice to each other. Wrong for each other. Rise for each other. Rise to each other.    
00:01:33
  Gina Vivar's Presentation: Rise to each other. Cuz you know I've done the classic stuff and it never works. So can we say we'll never say classic love to show it sunlight talking all night just enough to grow it now you It could be. Oh, it could be nice. Oh, to each other. We could be nice to Oh, to each other. M. Could be nice to Oh, to each other. Master to each Gina Vivar: All right, everyone. Welcome into enablement hour. It looks like we have low attendance, so I think we can get started um as people start to trickle in. Um we have a really exciting enablement today around psychic sales. We recently launched it. Super exciting stuff. Um we'll make sure to share this out so people who are running a little bit late can catch up on the content. But I'll go ahead and hand it off to Austin. Austin Reece: There we go. There's the mute button.    
00:03:29
  Austin Reece: Hi everybody. Um, give me one second. Just sending a note to the Fieldcom's channel. All right. So, uh, Sidekick Sales, as many of you hopefully saw, is GA. and so wanted to walk the team through what is it, who are we selling to, how does it work, how do we compare against our competitors, what are the assets you have available to you, all of the fun stuff. And so, um, Kyle, at any point feel free to jump in, but, uh, I'm going to go ahead and get this started for today. And then if you do have questions, uh, use the raise hand function and we'll just keep an eye on the queue and I'll try to call on people as we go. So all right for those of you familiar with command of the message the idea of saying like let's start with the problem and let's go to the solution wanted to just outline the problem that we're trying to solve for with sidekick sales. So there are four main things that we are focused on solving.    
00:04:31
  Austin Reece: The first is in the retail space in the e-commerce space online they're starting to see plateauing conversion rates despite all of their efforts to optimize. people are starting to kind of plateau um on that front. Rising CAC or customer acquisition cost makes every single visitor more expensive. Highard abandonment from unanswered product questions is a challenge and support is continuously seen as a cost center. And so the focus here is like what can we do about it and what's our unique perspective in the market? And so the tagline that we're going forward with psychic sales is turn every conversation into an opportunity for revenue. And so for us there is what is this a list of six different things that we think are kind of going to be positioning us to tackle this a little bit differently than competitors as well as help us differentiate ourselves. So the first thing pretty straightforward we want to convert hesitant shoppers. if you're on there, if you have questions, you know, we should try and make sure that we are taking advantage of those conversations and generating revenue from them.    
00:05:38
  Austin Reece: The goal from someone who manages an e-commerce site, right, is to increase average order value or AOV without discounting. You want to protect your margins. We also want to be able to take all of the product information and knowledge that they have on their website and use that to turn AI into your best sales associate and scale those experiences. One thing that we'll talk about as we go through this presentation, but the time to value is really fast for this product. We already have 23 customers live. They're already generating revenue. They're already answering product questions. They're already getting a ton of resolutions. And so, um, the goal here is for us to really use that as one of our key differentiators and say, you know, hey, you don't have to connect with your product catalog. You don't have to set up any in-depth integrations. You point Psychic Sales at your website. It reads the content on your website and the product pages as they exist today. That's where you keep it live and up to date.    
00:06:30
  Austin Reece: Anyways, and then you can go ahead and kind of use that as a knowledge source. We'll talk about that in a bit. Um, these last two things are another big differentiator for us. And when we get into the customer or competitor section, we'll hit on these a little bit more, but being a single touch point for service and sales really makes the customer experience better overall. You don't want to be talking to a different bot for product questions than you are for service questions. It should just be one continuous conversation with that brand. And then gladly uniquely positioned different from your your kind of sales AI assistants out there. We have all of the data about your customers, about your products, about the single life form conversation that you've had with the brand and service interactions to kind of inform the way in which we're able to resolve and assess those types of conversations. So, if I'm going to dumb it down to something super simple, I would say we are focused on increasing your average order value without increasing your customer acquisition costs.    
00:07:35
  Austin Reece: And so let's talk about what is sidekick sales. I think this is the big question on people's minds. So at its core when we think about it from like an internal perspective, Sidekick Sales is a new set of use cases for Sidekick that we're focused on building some features and functionality around it's answering product questions. It is doing product recommendations and doing assists as we're used to it today, but it'll provide a little bit different context when it's doing that handoff. So, it'll provide the live agent with information about, you know, what types of products you're interested, what questions you had, what things were recommended, so that we can make sure that, you know, hopefully average handle time is going down, resolution rates going up when a live agent actually gets that conversation. And so, what we're doing is we're kind of taking different features and functionality within the platform and we're packaging it into a single solution. We're calling it sidekick sales and we're targeting customer service and e-commerce leaders as our target buyers. And so those three different components that you've probably heard, you know, a good amount about.    
00:08:35
  Austin Reece: We've done a couple psychic sales trainings before, but are web content knowledge sources. So we're pointing psychic sales at their website and at their product pages, templated guides, which is, you know, kind of my understanding it's our first foray into guide templates. And so we have a a product recommendations and product Q&A template that they can use to make sure that that setup process is really easy. And then we lean very heavily on Gladly's already existing AI architecture. And so that is what we call psychic sales. So oops went too far. Hold on. So what do we mean when we say web content is a knowledge source? So essentially what we're doing is we're using a Google tool. I think it's called like URL context um informing or something like that. And essentially what it does is we point Scic, we point the model, the LLM, the AI at the website and we say use this as a knowledge source and it can pull a couple different things. It can pull text information from the website.    
00:09:37
  Austin Reece: It can pull images. It can pull PDFs and it can then take that and use that as context to give the best answer possible. And so just looking example here, this is Smith's website for some snowboarding goggles. I just took a screenshot of a couple different parts of the page that we might pull information from. Lots of customers spend a ton of time or lots of brands spend a ton of time making sure these pages are rich with information. So it has things like what are the product details, how does it fit, you know, what are the general categories, what's it best for, what is the um kind of value proposition of this product, what are the different color options or size options or or different things like that. And so all of that information can be taken by Sidekick and used to help inform those conversations that we're having with customers. The next part about this is um templated guides. So these are a couple screenshots of what the new experience looks like in Gladly, but you're all familiar when you create a guide in Gladly, the guide is used to inform the AI and provide guidance to Sidekick as to how to handle certain situations and conversations.    
00:10:42
  Austin Reece: And so Kyle and the engineering team have done a great job of creating a template for product questions and product recommendations that has a bunch of pre-built out sections that make it really easy for someone to get up and running and point this at their website and use their website as an source and then tell Sidekick what to do with that information. And so you go in and when you're we're creating a guide, you would select the questions and recommendations guide. you would kind of configure that to your liking from the template and then you would make sure that you're pointing it at um at the website. Kyle, anything else to add here that I didn't hit on? Kyle Kacius: No, I think just the the main thing is is that um you know, we're seeing customers get set up and using this in as little as 20 minutes. Um so, you know, kind of unlike some of the other guide types like Whismo and returns that, you know, might require a 20 minute conversation just to explain what it is or, you know, a two-hour conversation to figure out what APIs are needed.    
00:11:41
  Kyle Kacius: This is you can get it set up running live in production in less than 20 minutes. Um, which just, you know, really greatly improves the time to value, makes it a lot easier for customers, you know, to turn it on, test it out for a bit, you know, set up an initial set of URLs, then maybe add some more URLs. Um, it's it's very quick, uh, you know, to get this going. And so there's no reason why every customer shouldn't be testing this out. Austin Reece: Awesome. Yeah, 20 minutes, super fast. We've even got um some customers that within a week of testing it, they're already seeing additional revenue that they're tracking. Uh so yeah, really really huge step forward as far as like onboarding time is concerned. Kyle Kacius: Yeah. And and just real quick just to in real time address uh Jessica's question um it's completely dynamic. So um so yes like at the time that the customer is asking the question or the consumer is asking the question that is the time that we are pulling back that content and and determining which URL or or set of URLs that we should pull the content from and we're getting it you know we're getting it real time um at the type time that the consumer is asking the Question.    
00:13:12
  Austin Reece: Yeah, that's really cool. Um, Brandon, thanks for the clarification there in the chat. I think that's helpful and definitely a question that I know our customers will ask too. Okay. And then the last thing is we're already taking advantage of Glad's AI architecture. This is a slide that we're working on getting external facing. But the idea here is, you know, we have a very thorough thoughtout tech stack underneath the hood when it comes to how our AI works. We have a bunch of different models that we're using for the best scenarios. We have the context and knowledge layer that Gladly is uniquely positioned to facilitate things like website content, but also, you know, answers and actions and brand guidelines and all things like that. We have the trust layer, which is all the checks that go into when someone asks the AI a question. How does it make sure that the response is is trusted and on brand? We have all the different integrations that we can pull from and then obviously all the different platforms that we're working on connecting sidekick standalone with.    
00:14:14
  Austin Reece: So the infrastructure tried and tested and it's the same stuff that we use for all of the other sidekick conversations. So Kyle is going to take over from here and show an updated version of the demo that the engineering team is working on. You might have heard it called internally kickass demo. Um and yeah, really excited to show where this is going. This is something that we're working with uh the enablement group and some of the leaders on the solution consulting team to um make sure that we're going to get into the hands of this group as soon as we Kyle Kacius: All right, awesome. Um, so yeah, you know what we have today is we have a really good shopping assistant and that shopping assistant can help consumers with all of their product related questions before they make a purchase. And you know what that does is that ultimately means that as Austin mentioned, it's a higher likelihood that they're going to purchase, which increases conversion rate. it's a higher likelihood that they are going to buy more products which will increase the average order value and and then you know really the value and why I think uh we're getting such great attention from customers and prospects on this is because we can do this across the entire customer life cycle.    
00:15:37
  Kyle Kacius: We can have that pre-sales conversation. Then a customer can start asking about warranty information or return information. And then we can move, you know, kind of more post-sale type question. And then they can ask again about pre-sales, you know, about product information. And we can move back and forth fluidly all in the same chat experience, you know, all in the same experience for consumers. And I don't have to have one experience for pre-sales questions and one experience for post sales. It's all, you know, just like if I was talking to a human agent, it's all one place and we can answer both of those questions. Um, now because we're able to answer those pre-sales questions now and we're able to increase the average order value and the conversion rate and also ultimately drive revenue, we're getting a lot of interest from ecom leaders. Um, you know, VPs of digital, VP of e-commerce, they're really interested in this and that's not, you know, typically hasn't been our core buyer or the core champion who's interested in buying gladly.    
00:16:44
  Kyle Kacius: um but they have some specific needs that are a little bit different than a customer service leader. Um and so really what we've built this kickass demo to do is to really cater and show the ecom leader. We are we are catering to your needs. Um and we are you know really able to drive a great experience in in chat. Um so again this is you know kind of the the core driver behind this was conversations we had with ecom leaders and they said look I you know love that it's um love that we're able to engage consumers across the entire life cycle but we really need some things that will uh you know improve the chat experience and make customers more engaged while they're using chat. Um, so what we've done is really uh uplevelled the chat experience and again this is just uh we built this very quickly to be able to demo it. Um, and this will ultimately be coming into the product soon. Um, so what you can see here is is starting off we have a different uh a different chat button.    
00:18:00
  Kyle Kacius: Um, and I can actually type in my message here. Instead of it just being a button, I could actually write my message out in uh this right here. Um, and so I've already started a conversation, but if I had not started a conversation previously, I could, you know, write out my my question. Um, because I have started a conversation, I'm going to go ahead and open it up. And what we can see here is uh one, it's just an improved chat experience. We have the REI logo here. We have the ability to change the color of this up here. Just modernizes it a bit. You know, not nothing is um none of this is incredibly technically difficult. Nothing it was uh super complicated, but you know, just makes it look nicer, makes it look more modern. Um, you know, I'm having a conversation just like we can today with the existing Sidekick sales product, but the new thing you can see here is that it's returning an image. Um, and so I'm having a conversation saying, you know, my doctor recommends Hoka Clifton 10. Can you tell me more?    
00:19:11
  Kyle Kacius: It's not only giving me the text response and the image as we can today, but it's also or text response and the link, but it's also showing me an image. Um and then you know I say does it come in wide? Um, you know, again, giving me the response, showing me the image, and and this is all meant, you know, one, it looks nice, right? It just looks like a better experience. But because it's showing me an image, it's engaging the consumer more, which means that there's a higher likelihood that me as a consumer, I'm going to stay engaged, chatting, and it's a higher likelihood that I'm ultimately going to make a purchase. um you know I say hey I've got an ultra coming up again responds shows me the image but maybe I want to know about comparison you know how does this compare to other options here it's showing me multiple images now you know of course this is great it it shows me many images but as we have this become more engaging and you know we we have more of a rich experience with the consumer um you know this narrow narrow uh this narrow way of showing things especially on desktop doesn't always work.    
00:20:27
  Kyle Kacius: Sure, we could reduce the size of the images but what we have is actually a wider experience. So it's a more engaging chat experience um for consumers and you know this will also help cater to some of the other things that we're working on which is the ability to show tables. So, you know, for for this experience here where I'm saying, how does this compare to others, we actually uh are currently developing the ability to show, you know, one product and then all of the other products and and a table where I can, you know, very easily compare the different options and and make decisions quickly. Um, so again, a a lot coming around improved chat experience, images, um, you know, just a more engaging experience for the consumer. Um, and we're hoping to have this demo in demos in the next couple of weeks and then all of these features will be rolling out uh, you know, into the product over the next quarter or so. Austin Reece: Awesome. Thanks, Kyle. Nate Larkin: That's amazing. Austin Reece: Yeah, that's super exciting.    
00:21:39
  Austin Reece: Yeah. Um, and so just to be clear, I know the answer, but this is not specific to sidekick sales. Yeah. This is very much Kyle Kacius: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Not not specific to sidekick sales. We know that, you know, there's a number of c customers who aren't using sidekick sales uh who have, you know, given us a lot of feedback of we want a more modern chat experience. Um so this will just be something that will be available to everyone. you know where you go in today and you configure the chat experience. These will just be another set of options that you can turn on or off. You know, we know that like for instance, the wide chat experience doesn't suit everyone. Um that might not be something every customer wants. So again, just like everything else with chat, you'll have the option to turn this on or off. Austin Reece: Yeah, that's super cool. Yeah, I think one of the one of the trends that we're seeing in the e-commerce space in general is like over the last couple of years, you've had a bunch of players come out that do they focus on like search or the sales AI assistant agent or chat or like a bunch of different ways to engage with the brand and all of that is unifying into one simple experience.    
00:22:52
  Austin Reece: So, the amount of things that we can start to do with this over time, I think is just really exciting. It's not just service. It's not just sales. It's it's just how you talk with the brand overall or how you find out um you know find new products and and do search. Kyle Kacius: Yeah, I think I think overall this just this speaks to a broader trend and a a broader vision um where I think the entire industry will move which is a more conversational experience as AI gets header. Um, you know, it's going to be weird that I would look at a uh a long product page or multiple product page when I can just ask a question and and get my question answered. And, you know, that's a much more fluid, engaging experience. Um, and so I think, you know, that the way that uh I purchase things, the way that um I engage on a website is going to change. And that's really something that especially the more visionary champions that we talk to, it's really going to resonate.    
00:23:56
  Kyle Kacius: And so I think that's why, you know, kind of this this more engaging experience is is ultimately uh, you know, where the entire industry is going. Austin Reece: Yeah, very much so. Um, so Tito, great point in here. Just to clarify, no one has been a enabled to give this demo yet. Do not ask your local SC for them to pull this up in the demo. We will get it to them as soon as we possibly can. So, thanks for your patience, everyone. Um, Matt has a question about can we know who the customer is prior to them starting the conversation? Kyle, I'll let you take this one. Kyle Kacius: Yeah, definitely. So, we we have some ways already that we are able to do this um through what we have is uh we have the ability to set the user. Um so essentially you know if we the user is logged in or we just have the the user's email address from a different means there's some ways that um in the back end a customer can set it up where they are able to either what's called set the user if you don't know what that is ask your SC or have the ability to pass in a jot token which is a basically a way of kind of authent authenticating the user again if you don't know what that is ask your SC.    
00:25:22
  Kyle Kacius: Um, but the other thing that we are working on is generally just rethinking the way onboarding works in general. So even if you don't know who the user is upfront, um, it doesn't always make sense to start with asking for their name and email address, especially in these these, you know, sales related conversations. So giving more flexibility of when we ask for the name and email and in what scenarios we do. So you know you can manage in a world where in every sales related conversation we do not begin with asking the name and email and then if somebody starts asking about where's my order or I want to make a return or something where name and email is very important then we will ask for that email address or the phone number um you know or maybe I begin with a sales conversation and then I want to hand off or you know I need to hand off and get assistance from an agent. At that point, we would ask for the email address. Um, but ultimately we know that in those sales conversations, reducing the friction is very important.    
00:26:31
  Kyle Kacius: Um, and that's something that we're driving towards. Austin Reece: Yeah. Yeah. Lots and lots of just incredible updates coming to the chat. Um, every time that I I talk with Kyle, it's really cool to kind of just brainstorm how he's thinking about future improvements to the overall experience. So, thanks for sharing some things there. Uh for those of you that haven't met Matt Walters yet who asked that question in the chat, he's a new enterprise AE uh that just joined the team on Tuesday and uh him and I have worked together in a past life. So it's good to see you Matt. Matt Walters: Good see as well. Austin Reece: All right, so let's talk competition. So four buckets. What we're going to try to do on the enablement side of the house more consistently is well, let me let me kind of take a step back. The more we expand our reach into different use cases for Sidekick, the more we're going to come across just so many different competitors. And uh it's a lot easier for us to start to bucket those competitors by type rather than um actually train everybody to position against certain competitors.    
00:27:41
  Austin Reece: Now, for the major ones, we'll continue to develop assets and content to allow you to do so. But I like to think about the ones for psychic sales into four different buckets. So, there's AI shopping assistance, which is like Big Su, for example, if you're familiar with them. It's it's a dedicated chatbot that's going to kind of talk to you about shopping experiences. There's AI agents for customer service like Sierra. There's support suites, which we're all familiar with. And then there's product recommendations and discovery widgets that are like more static options. And so I'm going to go through each of these, talk about kind of what the experience is like, and then hit on how we position against um against each of these and where we think we win. So um starting with AI shopping assistants, we've got companies like Big Su, Live Person, Attentive, Zi, and Relish. Um we actually hired a new senior PMM who will be joining us next week who's coming from Live Person. Um the uh experience here can be very dedicated to just shopping and revenue generation.    
00:28:42
  Austin Reece: So uh again this is big su it has a lot of the things that Kyle's talking about. We're building toward things like tables for comparisons, things like product images and pricing. Um, they also like a lot of these companies also have like digital tryon rooms where you can like use AR, alternate reality or VR to be able to actually like try on the items or look at what the items might look like in real life. So, they're building a ton of like custom content to that experience. The AI agents for customer service, I mean, these are the ones we're all familiar with, you know, Sierra, Decagon, ADA, Forthought, etc. Uh, I just wanted to show you. So Sierra, they are like one of their key customers that they tout everywhere is Sonos, right? And I wanted to show you what the shopping experience is like with Sierra on Sonos. When I'm logged in and I'm a Sonos customer. I I have a ton of different Sonos items that I've bought directly from their website. It asks me for my email address.    
00:29:39
  Austin Reece: Um, you know, I'm asking for a subwoofer that works with my current setup. It says, you know, I can help you with compatibility, but can you share which which setup you have? And I was like, you know, do you know the products that I have? I'm logged in and it says, hey, you know, we don't have access to your system details, but you know, here's several options that we have. And then I give my my current setup and then they say, you know, here's some things that work well with it. A couple things to point out. And uh to be honest, Decagon was a lot worse here. They asked for just a ton of questions. Had no idea who I was even though I was logged in um on Hertz. But uh in here like they're not connected with the data. So whatever customer service platform that Sonos is using, they're not pulling information from that about me. It didn't know my name, my email address, anything like that. Even though I was logged in, there's nothing clickable in here.    
00:30:27
  Austin Reece: Um the formatting that they're using is extremely long worded, long- winded and there's no visuals. And so it's like right now like I know that we think of Sierra as this like high and mighty experience. They do a lot of things really well, right? But at the same time like we are on par and almost above um and definitely above because we provide links and things at our current state for where Sierra is today. Um since Yeah, go ahead. Nate Larkin: Is this is this universal for Sierra experiences or is this a implementation decision on Sonos's front? Austin Reece: It's a good question. On the three different Sierra brands that I tested it on yesterday, I got the same experience. So, small sample size, but uh pretty consistent. It's all the ones that they mentioned directly on their like logo wall on their website. Cool. All right. So, support suites, you know them. I'm not going to spend a ton of time talking about them. This is like customer, intercom, zenesk, etc. And then product discovery.    
00:31:34
  Austin Reece: So this is a new um space that as we start to talk to more and more e-commerce buyers, we'll be fighting for dollars for. And so um the main companies in here are companies like Nostto and Dynamic Yield and Alolia. Those are probably the top three that you'll see. Um, Nostto and Dynamic Yield provide like static or dynamic widgets that you can put on your different product pages or different places on your website that plug into your product catalog and recommend products based on a bunch of different factors. Some of these can recommend things based on, you know, activity as you're bouncing around the site and the things you're looking at. They can recommend things based on, you know, products that people also bought with this item. they can be kind of pre- um preddecided on bundles by the brand. So maybe the brand says, "Hey, every time that someone looks at this item, recommend these two items to go with it." Um there's a whole like spectrum with these tools of very rigid guidelines where the brand is saying recommend this item specifically to very like machine learning driven algorithms where it's saying based on all this data that we have about the customer or about this product, recommend these things.    
00:32:42
  Austin Reece: Um, so just something to keep in mind there. So, uh, we'll provide you with this later, so no need to screenshot it. It'll be on the enablement site. But this is our differentiation in a nutshell. So when you have AI shopping assistance, you have, you know, they're trying to guide shoppers to reduce abandonment. They really need cataloges or integrations with product cataloges and they don't have context about that customer in a lot of cases. They're not plugging into your customer support offering. They're not integrating with other systems in most cases. They're connected to the product catalog. They can recommend products. And so for us, our positioning is look, we're the fastest way to launch conversational commerce. We don't have to connect into the product catalog. And it's the single lifelong conversation, the customer profile, the context that Gladly has. It is all there to reinforce um and make that conversation experience better. and we're uniting service and sales conversations into one chat experience. And so it's kind of like this idea of setup and minutes and a single conversation.    
00:33:46
  Austin Reece: Those are kind of the two main things that that we win or that we expect will win on in that area. On the AI agents for customer service side, you know, these brands and in all of the like I'll say like behind the scenes documentation that we've seen from them like like onboarding decks and things like that, they're focused on deflection. focused on deflection as much as possible. Most of them don't focus on assists. And so their goal is automate everything, make things more efficient, deflect as many conversations. And so for us, where we think that we'll win is that on the support and sales conversation side and then saying, okay, look, you are already having all these conversations. Why not take advantage of them and turn them into revenue? Um, and Tito, yeah, that's right. we see like Sierra can integrate with a lot of things but they're not they're more focused on the customer service side and not on the sales side at this point. Um on the support suite side um you know we are a support suite now that drives sales and so the goal here and the way that we want to want to position it is this is actually taking your support team and turning them into um a growth engine rather than a cost center.    
00:34:59
  Austin Reece: And then on the product and discovery side, this one's pretty easy to be honest. This is like those, you know, they have the context about the products. They might have some context about customer behavior on the website. We have all the conversation and all the context about the customer, the products, everything you've ever done with them, every service interaction you've ever had. And we engage live. Those are very passive experiences when they're recommending things on widgets on the site. A conversation is actually something where you have a chance to handle objections and actually recommend certain things that are specific to their situation about what they're telling you about rather than just what you know or assuming about them based on their behavior. So back to kind of a quick summary of what we started with at the top setup in minutes lifelong conversation unified sales and service touch point. Every conversation that you're already having there's an opportunity to generate revenue from that. um proving that support is a growth engine and not a cost center and then engaging live, recommending live and converting live rather than being static.    
00:36:04
  Austin Reece: Okay, I'll pause there. On the competitive side, any other questions or things that um the leadership team wants to bring up. All right. So, let's talk go to market. Right now, as of like today, we are recommending that you focus on the customer service as our main buyer persona. It will be a easier conversation to have for people who are using Gladly or expecting to use Gladly or we're selling to on the customer service side based on the functionality that we have today. In early October, we will be very close to having a lot of the functionality that Kyle showed in his demo experience that we think will help us unlock the e-commerce buyer persona. In addition to that, the team is also building toward revenue tracking. So, being able to track the actual revenue attribution from these conversations as well as a couple of other e-commerce specific product features that we think will make those conversations a lot easier. And so we're expecting early October, we can start to kick off sales cycles and customer conversations with e-commerce buyers.    
00:37:20
  Austin Reece: And then by the time that those are starting to get to the point in which they would, you know, demo and start to negotiate and buy, we feel like we'll be in a really good place to be able to win those deals. Yeah, Nate. Nate Larkin: The the only thing I wanted to add to this is as we're all thinking Sidekick Standalone, it's important to remember that whatever we're building for Sidekick, these key components from a front-end standpoint, we can leverage within Sidekick Standalone. So don't think like, oh, we have to wait to talk about this sort of stuff. Like this is where we're going. Um, and this will also be available from a standalone perspective. Austin Reece: Yeah, exactly. It's a really good point. Cool. So, if I was going to give the elevator pitch to a customer service leader, here's the things that I would focus on. I would paint the problem as, you know, support is turning into a revenue driver over time. Maybe it's not the problem, but if you're not turning your support team into a revenue driver, that is a problem.    
00:38:24
  Austin Reece: Customer conversations are getting more complex with different touch points into the sales into service into into product recommendations into other types of things. And so you need a single solution that unifies those conversation that recommends products, handles those pre-purchase questions and then accelerates live agent handoffs with context. And the goal here is to prove supports direct impact on revenue because that'll open up a lot of opportunities for leaders on the support side. And um you know, we've already hit on this a bunch of times. This is just repetition at this point. These are the kind of messaging pillars that we're going to market with that all of our marketing materials, pitch decks, videos, all different kinds of content is going to include these six things as the key kind of ways in which we want to differentiate oursel and talk about the solution in the market. And then yeah, I think like this is a uh case in which during the limited rollout phase before we went GA with this product, Kyle and the customer success team have done an incredible job at getting 23 well-known customers live on this and actually using it.    
00:39:44
  Austin Reece: And um in the command of the message guide that we'll share with you after this, you'll see there's a couple of data points. There's a couple anonymized data points of customers who are already using it and the resolution rates they're seeing and the assist rates they're seeing. It's some really cool stuff. So just wanted to give a big shout out to the team. Um you know, they've already gotten customers live and it's already working for them and generating revenue for them. So huge. And uh an example here, Tokovas. Tokovas I think was one that was early on and so we've been able to kind of build that relationship with them and and have them do an approved quote and an approved stat but um the head of CXOPS at Tokovas Crystal said Psychic Sales helped us connect with high intent shoppers in the moment guide them to the right products and drive immediate revenue all while laying the groundwork for long-term loyalty and they saw a 55% resolution rate for product questions and product recommendation questions.    
00:40:39
  Austin Reece: So already pretty immediately they're seeing big results. And okay, this is the last slide here. We built a ton of things to hopefully help you sell this. I would love feedback on these assets as you start to use them. If there's anything any changes that we can make, please let me know in the ask enablement channel. But you have a messaging brief. This is mostly for the um go to market teams that are going to be building content to communicate externally. So think like uh this should inform BDR outbound campaigns. This should inform marketing materials. This should inform how we talk about things on support pages. All of that for the field team specifically in customer conversations. We built a command of the message guide. I've worked really closely with Alex on this to make sure that it's um built out in a way that'll help everybody here. If you're not familiar with command of the message, please go review that and then happy to sit down with anybody and walk through that in detail.    
00:41:34
  Austin Reece: If you are interested in the thought process that went into evaluating how we position ourselves in the space, I've also provided everyone with the market analysis that we did so you can get a better understanding for who else exists in the space, how they position themselves, and the gaps that we thought we could go and actually take advantage of. There is a new slide insert um that we've created to add to your pitch decks. It's a couple of slides that um outline the problem and then talk about the solution and have the proof point slide. Uh I have gone through and recorded myself giving an example presentation of how I might present those slides. So feel free to watch that. There's also this guide here which is a script if you want it the first couple times that you're getting used to it and some of like the key points to hit on. Um, we've also got that differentiator battle card that I showed earlier. And then we have some existing assets that we already had, which is the one pager and the hype video that you're welcome to use and share externally as well.    
00:42:34
  Austin Reece: So, um, with that being said, any other questions before we head out? Yeah. Alex Tzeng: Yeah, let me kick off first by saying Austin, this is incredible. Uh, the difference in enablement from the day I got here until now is vastly different. So, Matt Walters, this is a huge upgrade you get to take advantage of, my friend. Um, the second question actually I had was more towards Kyle is as you were going through a lot of the benefits and the way that we would want to talk through sidekick sales and the changes that we're seeing Austin Reece: Hey, Alex Tzeng: in the market. I'm curious, Kyle, like when you're having most of the conversations, you've had a lot of the early combos with existing clients, do they talk about first like, hey, here's the changes we're seeing as a business internally, right? So, we're seeing CX and sales aligning or are they starting by talking about their buyers journey is changing. It's just like a small distinction when we're engaging with customers where we say, "Hey, a lot of the changes we're seeing is your buyers are are their buying journey and their buying process looks different now. We    
00:43:40
  Alex Tzeng: have to mirror that in your business and you're going to start to see a synergy between yourself and e-commerce because you have to do that because that's what your buyers are seeing or business is the one leading that and anticipating that change because of AI changes. It's just a small distinction in terms of maybe how we message that early on in conversations. Kyle Kacius: Yeah, it's it's a great question and I I think the the most common thing I hear is, you know, we typically talk to the CX leader, right? and they're saying, "Our e-commerce team is getting pitched XYZ AI uh sales agent." um you know our e-commerce team is hearing that XYZ sales agent big su you know there's a bunch of other ones out there are able to drive increased conversion rates increase average order value increase revenue and they're also being told by the board that they need to use AI more so they are going and they're evaluating these solutions they're just kind of going and they're throwing them on the website um and they're seeing mixed results from those.    
00:44:51
  Kyle Kacius: But the problem that creates is it's a disjointed consumer experience, right? Because then you have one widget for sales, one widget for customer service. And you know what I like sometimes they're okay having the two different experiences. Sometimes because e-commerce owns the website experience, they're actually saying get that service uh widget, you know, get gladly off and just put the sales agent because that can actually drive revenue. Um, you know, so that kind of creates two things. One, it's a it's a risk to Gladly um because uh you know, it's removing Gladly Chat from the experience. And two, it's a disjointed consumer experience, you know, if they have the two widgets. So, you know, when I when I talk to customers, um, you know, and I talk to e-commerce leaders, I'm like, "Hey, you don't have to choose. You can have it all in the same experience. You can create that, you know, a really good consumer experience and you can show that you're driving revenue and they're like, "Yes, this is great. Um, you know, this this is exactly what we want." Does    
00:46:05
  Kyle Kacius: that answer your question, Alex? Alex Tzeng: Yeah, absolutely it does. Um, and so I I like that because I think again it's just in terms of like in most of our first meetings, how are we telling the story to I think a lot of these new brands. And so what it sounds like is I think most of the trends that we've seen within CX and the technology that supports it have been buyer driven, whether or not it's like social, right, whether or not it's online, those are things that buyers are demanding and asking for. This is kind of the first time that it's like leaders within a business continue to go to their people and say, "We have to use AI. How are you going to do it?" And everybody's like, "I have no f****** clue, but I'm going to figure it out." And so, this is something that we can get ahead of. But it's the first time I've seen like a major trend that's internal driven as opposed to externally driven. So, um, just really interesting, I think, again, in terms of how we engage some of our, uh, prospective clients.    
00:46:51
  Alex Tzeng: So, thanks, Kyle. I appreciate it. Austin Reece: Kristen, you had a question. Kristen Miller: Yeah, thanks Austin. Um, this is really exciting. I guess my question would be I heard you talk about the product catalog. Um, and I'm I I guess my question to you is are we agnostic to their commerce system? So, if they use Salesforce Commerce or Adobe Commerce Cloud, does that pose challenges to us from an integration perspective or are we just assuming that we're agnostic there because we have enough information from the product catalog that's publicly available? Kyle Kacius: We are completely agnostic to the uh to the e-commerce system. Um and the reason why is because we are just pulling the content that is on the web page. So we are pulling the same content that a consumer would see. But you know of course what we are then doing is we are pulling all of that content but we can pull it from five different pages and then we can summarize it and give a really clear answer addressing just the consumer's question rather than the consumer having to go and read read those five different pages you know and all of you know the multiple pages worth of information and keep scrolling.    
00:48:04
  Kyle Kacius: You know, this is especially important on a mobile device where the, you know, my attention span is very low. I just want an answer to what is the best trail running shoe, um, you know, for my wide feet and is it available today and I don't want to go search and I don't want to, you know, go read a bunch. Um, and so, yeah, we are just pulling back the information from the website and completely agnostic. Kristen Miller: Okay, awesome. One quick follow on. Um, I don't want to confuse nomenclature here, but would we look at this like we've traditionally viewed actions? Because we're leveraging APIs, this is considered an action. Kyle Kacius: I I want to Yeah, I want to be very clear. All you have to do to use this is put in your the website URL. And so, you know, if somebody wants to use Sephora and Sephora wants to recommend products, all they have to do is put in sephora.com. Kristen Miller: That's amazing. Kyle Kacius: If they want to limit it to, you know, they want to run a test and they want to only do, you know, Sephora makeup, then it could be sephora.com/makeup, you know, and then it would limit it to only products in that make, you know, that that contained that.    
00:49:17
  Kyle Kacius: And so basically only products in the makeup category. Kristen Miller: Awesome. Thank you, Kyle. Kyle Kacius: So yeah, there's no API integration needed. And that's really what enables the get it set up in less than 20 minutes. Alex Tzeng: Sorry. Yeah. And I I like the question, Christian, because I agree. It's it's like we're integrating with write their commerce solutions because the commerce solutions are designed to power the websites, but it's a much lower lift to doing it. The only question I did have Kyle just like thinking of like our Abberrombie conversation is I know in some of these like inventory is always coming up and availability of product. Curious just like where that conversation is progressing because that's not on their websites. And so how are we just thinking a little bit more around that in terms of like hey we can recommend products but then they're always thinking about is that available where is that available to them store locations. So just curious I know obviously there's not a perfect answer that to that yet but how is that evolving?    
00:50:10
  Kyle Kacius: Yeah, I mean you know this can always be used alongside uh API integration. So if you want to have this get back the product to recommend and then a customer asks is that in stock you can tell the guide you can set it up with you know and say when a customer asks about stock information then use this API and do this integration um you know with XYZ e-commerce platform or inventory management platform or whatever. Um, so it's not an or, it's an and. Um, just the URL information makes it really easy, uh, you know, to get to get started quickly and that's typically good enough for for customers. Um, but yeah, they they can always they can always augment it with more information and and do additional API integrations. Alex Tzeng: Got it. Perfect. That makes sense. Sign Austin Reece: All right. Any other questions? Cool. As a reminder, all of this will live in the revenue enablement micro site. There's a product section. Underneath that product section or menu is psychic sales. Uh I believe Gina's going to be posting a follow-up message in the fieldcom's channel uh later today with links to all of the assets that we talked about.
