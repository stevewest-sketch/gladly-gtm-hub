Notes Length: Standard
	•	Transition of Series Ownership and Meeting Logistics Emilio Di Zazzo announced changes to the meeting timing due to other conflicts, and apologized for the less than ideal attendance. Di Zazzo is handing over ownership of the series to Christian Shockley, who is working with Steve (McKenna) and Gina on enablement. Shockley will own the agenda and content, emphasizing that the forum is also a "playground for practicing in front of your peers". Shockley outlined housekeeping items, including upcoming continued training sessions with Emily and Gina and updates on comp plans from Jenny B and their team, which may include office hours.
	•	Introduction of the New First Meeting Deck Christian Shockley introduced the 2.0 first meeting deck, noting that it will likely be updated in late November or early December to reflect changes in the narrative, following the GTM all hands meeting. Shockley encouraged the team to use this deck aggressively, comparing it to a pair of cleats meant to be "scuffed up" and customized, rather than "Gucci loafers". They requested that users tag themself, Steve West, and Austin when using customized versions of the deck to help the team understand what content lands and to refine the sidekick standalone messaging.
	•	Overview and Usage of the Mega Deck Steve West clarified that the "First Meeting Deck" is a mega deck of resources intended for the initial pitch of Gladly, whether to a small audience or a buying committee. The deck is designed to be a comprehensive resource, potentially growing to 150 slides, that can be used for meetings ranging from 8 to 20 slides. West emphasized that this is the approved source for slides, eliminating the need to search Slack or wait for announcements, with release numbers clearly marked in the title.
	•	Deck Content and Narrative Transition Steve West addressed that Gladly is experiencing an "identity crisis," transitioning from a "heroheavy company to an AI forward company," and that the story and pitch slides in the deck support the existing narrative while the company finalizes the new pitch. The deck contains a primary narrative section covering POV, solution, and core features, followed by a separate arsenal of slides that include additional imagery, a few architecture slides, and the social proof template with all case studies. The deck also includes vertical kits with industry-matching product images and use case slides developed for each target vertical, such as travel and hospitality, telecommunications, and quick service restaurants.
	•	Tooling and Feedback on the New Deck Steve West mentioned that the team will continue to improve the deck as a tool, possibly by adding a guide book slide for navigation, and suggested using the 'Command F' (or 'Control F') function for searching within the deck. Marcus Tetwiler and Steph Marte both praised the deck as a one-stop shop for approved and refreshed content, with Tetwiler specifically appreciating the vertical breakouts and practical search tip. Steph Marte and Jezzica Bellitti requested more enablement on architecture and the underlying models, infrastructure, and stacks, with West confirming that more refined tools and enablement are forthcoming, with Everly currently owning the refinement of architecture materials.
	•	Process for Deck Utilization and Feedback Christian Shockley requested specific feedback from SMB folks like Christine and Karl Rehfuss, especially concerning modifications for hero-pitching scenarios. When asked about the expectation for submitting custom decks, Steve West clarified that the team does not care when the customized decks are sent, as the goal is for the team to "battle test it" and share perspective on what slides land or do not. Emilio Di Zazzo stressed the importance of nailing and refining the main problem statement, which is central to the strategy and messaging in a crowded market. Shockley concluded by stating that they will circulate a proposed agenda for the series and requested feedback to make the time most useful .

Suggested next steps
	•	The group will tag Steve West, Christian Shockley, and Austin to share the deck that they used in their meetings.
	•	Christian Shockley will take feedback from Christine and Karl Rehfuss regarding modifications needed specifically for SMB use cases and hero slides within the deck.
	•	Christian Shockley will circulate his proposed agenda for this meeting moving forward.
