Summary
Steve West announced the availability of new standalone demo materials, including Figma mocks for the third-party help desk, on the Sidekick standalone microsite. Christian Eberle clarified that the Figma mocks, designed to illustrate a complete handoff story to ZenDesk, are the advised demo route until a live ZenDesk demo is built. Steve West also explained Sidekick's core architecture and its "trust layer," emphasizing consistent knowledge sources and secure, context-aware escalations, while Julianne Lind and Kevin Dick inquired about intent detection and compatibility with help desk reporting and analytics. Christian Shockley announced a four-to-six-week demo training track launching on September 29th.

Details
	•	Standalone Demo Materials and Flow Steve West announced that new standalone demo materials, including Figma mocks for the third-party help desk portion, are available on the Sidekick standalone microsite. The demo flow largely mirrors the Ritali Outdoors certification, requiring the removal of the "hero" portion and insertion of the new help desk section. Christian Eberle clarified that the Figma mocks were not designed with the current demo flow in mind, leading to a potentially "jarring" experience when transitioning from Ritali. They suggested pivoting smoothly to the Figma to discuss handoff capabilities in a help desk environment. Steve West reiterated that while there are multiple options for the demo, the third-party platform handoff can only be shown in one specific way.
	•	Figma Mock Details and Capabilities Steve West detailed that the Figma mock is designed to illustrate a complete handoff story, starting with a new automated conversation with a customer named Julie. This mock showcases Sidekick's ability to display information, identify when escalation is necessary, and transfer the conversation to a ZenDesk interface, including the full transcript and a handoff summary. The system also allows for structured fields to be populated with customer data, enabling agents to resolve issues without the customer repeating information, thus maintaining a continuous story within the self-contained Figma mock.
	•	ZenDesk Demo Environment Katie Culp inquired whether to use the Figma route for ZenDesk competitions given an existing demo environment. Christian Eberle clarified that the previous ZenDesk environment was a prototype for asynchronous handoffs and is not enabled for live chat. They advised using the Figma demo 99% of the time until a live ZenDesk demo experience is built, which is expected by October 1st.
	•	Sidekick's Core Architecture and Trust Layer Steve West explained that Sidekick's underlying architecture remains consistent, whether operating as a full suite within Gladly or as a standalone product. This architecture, termed "experience orchestration," enables accurate and trusted responses, secure transactions, and contextual escalations to third-party systems. The system utilizes the same knowledge sources, guides, and escalation rules and offers performance insights regardless of the platform. Steve West further elaborated on the "trust layer," a crucial component where every Sidekick response undergoes checks for tone, brand alignment, fact-checking, hallucination prevention, promise detection, compliance, and safety before reaching the customer. Responses must pass a confidence threshold, and if they fail twice, they are escalated to an agent, ensuring trustworthiness, brand consistency, and safety across all channels and platforms.
	•	Enterprise Integrations and App Platform T Do raised a question regarding integrations for homegrown or unarticulated systems, asking if the approach of building middleware through the app platform would remain the same. Steve West affirmed that this is an area the team is actively addressing, acknowledging that this component needs to be properly incorporated into the presentation. Christian Eberle added that while many logos are shown on the "human collaboration" slide, the current focus for demos is a subset of four, with plans to quickly roll out similar integrations for Fresh Chat, Dixa, and Help Scout. Salesforce will take longer due to the need for a consultant. Other CCaaS logos, like Genesis, represent the ability to hand off voice AI with any provider through simple call forwarding.
	•	Handoff and Routing Rules Julianne Lind inquired about the responsibility for creating routing rules based on the handoff. Christian Eberle clarified that the help desk is responsible for these rules, explaining that anything that would typically happen after Sidekick in Gladly now occurs within the help desk. Kevin Dick supported this by noting that this approach is standard among third-party AI providers.
	•	Intent Detection and Data Exposure Julianne Lind asked about Sidekick's intent detection capabilities and whether that data is exposed to third parties. Christian Eberle confirmed that Sidekick does perform intent recognition to guide its actions and outcomes. However, they stated that this data is not currently exposed to third parties, meaning the help desk cannot directly utilize it.
	•	Compatibility with Help Desk Reporting and Analytics Kevin Dick raised concerns about applying topics, tags, and ticket fields for full compatibility with help desk reporting and analytics, particularly for ZenDesk. Christian Eberle indicated that more information would be available by the end of September, with an MVP release on October 1st. Enhancements including tags for ZenDesk are planned by the end of October. They specified that while tags will be added, ticket fields and forms will not be edited. Christian Eberle noted that working with existing code allows for quicker enhancements based on product feedback, should additional features be needed.
	•	Demo Training Track Christian Shockley announced a four-to-six-week demo training track launching on September 29th, aiming to establish common demo principles and build up to a full 45-minute demo with a focus on Sidekick Standalone. The training will include modules covering "under the hood" technical elements, sessions led by BP and product experts, and small group practice sessions to provide feedback. A pre-training survey will be distributed to gauge familiarity with principles, pitfalls, and desired technical enablement.

Suggested next steps
	•	Christian Eberle will provide more information about the MVP rollout by the end of September, as it's scheduled for October 1st.
	•	Christian Shockley will launch a four to six-week demo training track on September 29th and send out a pre-training survey later today or tomorrow morning.
